# Data Analysis in Excel

This project was conducted to showcase how I used Excel  to analyze data. 
The brewery dataset used for this analysis aimed to provide necessary insights that would help the manager make informed decisions for the growth of the business. 
The dataset was imported into SQL to extract data for the retail company and then imported into Excel for visualization. 
The project also included hands-on experience with Excel functions and tools, as well as a documented thought process.
